        "third-paragraph": "Programming is to see your logic expressed in a computer telling it what to do, it is something that challenges you constantly and I think the best way to learn is to do projects directly, this really strengthens the skills not only in the language in which you program but also improves the ability to solve problems.",
        "fourth-paragraph": "I am now looking for a full-time job where I can contribute my skills to a company, achieve goals and continue to grow professionally."
